GENERAL TODO AND IDEAS:

Ideas:
	Lightkeks: 
		Languages: 
			might convert "languages.*" into seperate files to create which can be accessed outside which the user can edit to its own?
			like we dont need this anymore, creating a basic file which the user can edit at it's own will? option should be switchable
			in the console or as player in it's OP-state. like "/changelang"?
			TODO: Changing language for each player?
			TODO: /language set//get
			
		Debugging-Info:
			like "/debug" which only the real dev's can see? all information should be displayed for console and for ingame real dev's.
			if anyone's getting trouble using our plugin so they can contact us via ingame chat using "/devhelp <message>" which could
			create a file or sending a message to our discord server throught a bot?
		
		LannguageManager.java:
			Adding client-side language setting? hard to code, but possible anyways. server should look up where's the user's coming from
			so it could auto set it to it's most usable language? 

Lightkeks:
	Commands:
		Home:
			* TODO Implementing hasNoHome (delhome, home)
			* TODO Implementing hasHome (home, delhome)
			* TODO Implementing hasAlreadyHome (sethome)
			* TODO Implementing changeLocHome (sethome)
			* TODO Implementing changeLocHomeOtherPlayer (sethome)
		All cmds:
			* TODO adjusting all permissions and all language-linkings in all cmds (still working on it)
			
davidmc971:
	Command structure:
		AbstractCommand
			now the basis for every Command, in the package commands, every command will be loaded automatically
			TODO: at the moment it has to be in plugin.yml to be executable, could be automated

	System of interfacing with players and console:
		LanguageManager [Still TODO:]
		ChatUtils [Still TODO:]
	
	Internal data management:
		DataManager
			-> switch mostly from yml to json, but still keep support
		PermissionManager [TODO:]
		
	General utilities:
		Utils
	Lightkeks:
		Interface für Einteilung zw. Spigot, Bukkit und Forge und dass wir die Daten auf gleiche Art und Weise bekommen können
		Feature: Annotation wie Forge only/Spigot only/Bukkit only
	Lightkeks:
		settings.yml mit Währungseinstellung
		loading currency while set in settings.yml like $ or €
	Lightkeks:
		Filtering bad words? Wäre eine sehr gute Idee für alle die, die nicht unbedingt beleidigungen oder böse wörter im chat haben wollen.
	Lightkeks:
		Verwarnsystem? Textchat-farbe des jenigen ändert sich auf gelb wenn einmal verwarnt, beim zweiten mal rot und beim dritten mal fliegt die person?
