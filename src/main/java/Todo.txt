GENERAL TODO AND IDEAS:

Ideas:
	Lightkeks: 
		Languages: 
			might convert "languages.*" into seperate files to create which can be accessed outside which the user can edit to its own?
			like we dont need this anymore, creating a basic file which the user can edit at it's own will? option should be switchable
			in the console or as player in it's OP-state. like "/changelang"?
			
		Debugging-Info:
			like "/debug" which only the real dev's can see? all information should be displayed for console and for ingame real dev's.
			if anyone's getting trouble using our plugin so they can contact us via ingame chat using "/devhelp <message>" which could
			create a file or sending a message to our discord server trought a bot?
		
		LannguageManager.java:
			Adding client-side language setting? hard to code, but possible anyways. server should look up where's the user's coming from
			so it could auto set it to it's most usable language? 

Lightkeks:

	Command structure:
		AbstractCommand
			now the basis for every Command, in the package commands, every command will be loaded automatically
			TODO: at the moment it has to be in plugin.yml to be executable, could be automated

	System of interfacing with players and console:
		LanguageManager
		ChatUtils
	
	Internal data management:
		DataManager
			-> switch mostly from yml to json, but still keep support
		YamlManager [deprecated?]
		JsonManager [TODO]
		PermissionManager [TODO]
		Statistics [what exactly?]
		
	General utilities:
		Utils
